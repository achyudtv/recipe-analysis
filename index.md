### Introduction
This dataset is based off recipes and their ratings/reviews posted on food.com since 2008. There are two datasets, recipes and ratings, which we are combining to get one big dataset which contains 234,429 reviews (rows in our dataset) of over 80,000 recipes. This vast dataset gives us a great way to predict a recipe's ratings (which is the average rating column we created) based on numerous columns in our combined dataset like 'minutes' (amount of time to prepare a recipe), 'nutrition' (nutrition information of a recipe including its calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, and carbohydrates) and 'n_steps' (number of steps of a recipe). This well help us understand which qualities are more or less useful in getting good rated recipes, meaning if someone wants good reviews to the recipe online, they know what factors would most influence their recipe's ratings.
